                This tier guide rates ships on a scale from 1-11 with 11 
                being the highest, based on their performance within the 
                role(s) and situations. The ships are rated based on max level,
                full retrofit, and fate simulation 5 unless explicitly mentioned 
                otherwise. In order to make a dispute refer to the information page. 
                Ships are not rated with their faction buffer unless stated.
